# put_tello_selfie
DJI Tello selfie "stick" is the project about creating drone following the person in some distance. It can be used for recording purposes by professional performers and streamers. We based our idea in using ArUco Tags. We couldn't stress the idea better than picturing this like below.



## Installation
We recommend using Python 3 for the project
Make sure you are using virtual environment in python so to keep your system interpreter intact.
The short tutorial how to do this is published in the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
Install pytello and opencv library.

```bash
pip install pytello opencv-python
```
## Run
